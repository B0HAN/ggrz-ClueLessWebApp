List of known bugs
    - Players are not being able to be removed from space objects, this is causing no issues since moving is based
        on current location in Player objects
    - NPC, do not have a datafield to keep track of their locations, currently only UI will track this and backend
        is not keeping any data on their location
    - Suggestion made in room that is not the current room will result in suspect being moved anyways. UI will display
        that the subject was moved but the backend will actually moved player to current room
    - Currentlt returning strings with emit messages but we should change this to data and create the message in app.py 
    - Need to update UI with locations and cards for each person
    - game over for all players failing
